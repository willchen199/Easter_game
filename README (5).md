# Overview

I try to practice on the coding skill in Python so I figure creating a easter would be fun and able to learn more about python

This is a 2D egg catching game. The eggs will fall from the sky and user have to move the bucket to collect the falling eggs.

The purepose of this project is to get familer with Python synth and practice functional programming.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
